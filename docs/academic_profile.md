# Academic Background

## Education

### University of Chinese Academy of Sciences                         
      
    - M.S. in Fundamental Mathematics     Sep 2021 -- Jul 2024

### Harbin Institute of Technology                                                 

    - B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics     Sep 2017 -- Jul 2021

## Research Interest

My research interests include online optimization and Riemannian optimization. I focus on online matching problems inspired by real-world applications such as real-time advertising, resource allocation in cloud computing, and matching users in ride-sharing platforms. Within online matching, I am particularly intrigued by stochastic models, including stochastic rewards and the Philosopher Inequalities.

Additionally, I am passionate about Riemannian Optimization and learning approaches. This field leverages the geometric properties of Riemannian manifolds to develop algorithms that address challenges associated with non-Euclidean data.
