# Welcome to My Homepage!

## My name is Haoxin Sang (Hollis).

I'm excited to share my journey as a PhD student in CS at the University of Alberta. Welcome to my blog!

Here, you'll find insights into my research, experiences as an international student, and reflections on various topics in Computer Science. (1)
